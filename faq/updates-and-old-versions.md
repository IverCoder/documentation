# Updates and old versions

### Older versions will be deprecated?

We keep the main versions of Bottles actively developed:

| Release      | Status      | Notes                               |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Trento       | Active      | n/a                                 |
| Treviso (v3) | EOL         | No support. Use latest version.     |
| v2           | EOL         | No support. Use latest version.     |
| v1           | Maintenance | Only severe bug and security fixes. |

### Backward compatibility

Thanks to a common model and an internal update system, you can update Bottles without worrying about anything. You can import Bottles v1 prefixes via the built-in importer.
