# Import from other managers

## Import from other managers

Currently we support migration from these applications:

* Bottles V1
* Lutris
* PlayOnLinux

### How to import

You can access the import tools from the Bottles main menu by selecting the "Import/export" option.

![Bottles - Main Menu](../.gitbook/assets/bottles/import/ContextMenu.png)

The "Importer" window will open.

![Bottles - Importer](../.gitbook/assets/bottles/import/Importer.png)

Clicking on the Refresh button (![Bottles - Importer - Refresh Button](../.gitbook/assets/bottles/import/RefreshButton.png)) will launch a search for wineprefixes available for import.

Button ![Bottles - Importer - Import Button](../.gitbook/assets/bottles/import/ImportButton.png) allows you to import bottle backups created earlier ([Backups & Duplicate](./backups.md)).
