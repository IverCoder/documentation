### General

In the **General** section you can configure the Bottles appearance and general settings.

Appearance settings:

* Toggle dark mode \(turn off the lights\)
* Show update date \(this will toggle the last edit date in the bottles list\)

General settings:

* Notifications \(choose if Bottles should display notifications in your desktop\)
* Temp files \(toggle to prune the temp directory on Bottles start, this will reduce the disk used by Bottles but also forcing re-download dependencies when installing in new bottles\)
* Close Bottles after starting a program \(this works only when Bottles was started from the file manager or using the CLI\)

Advanced settings:

* Custom bottles path \(specifies the directory that Bottles should use to search for existing bottles and create new ones\)
