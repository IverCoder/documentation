# App preferences

To access Bottles preferences, just press the menu button and select **Preferences**. 

Preferences shows four sections:

* General
* Runners
* DXVK/VKD3D
* Experiments

In the **General** section you can configure the Bottles appearance and general settings.

Appearance settings:

* Toggle dark mode \(turn off the lights\)
* Show update date \(this will toggle the last edit date in the bottles list\)

General settings:

* Notifications \(choose if Bottles should display notifications in your desktop\)
* Temp files \(toggle to prune the temp directory on Bottles start, this will reduce the disk used by Bottles but also forcing re-download dependencies when installing in new bottles\)
* Close Bottles after starting a program \(this works only when Bottles was started from the file manager or using the CLI\)

In the **Runners** section you can list, browse and install new runners which can be used to create new bottles. [Read more](../components/runners.md).

From the **DXVK/VKD3D** section you can list, browse and install new versions of DXVK and VKD3D. [Read more](../components/dxvk.md).

The Experiments sections show all the work in progress \(unstable\) features that will be integrated in Bottles in the future. [Versioning](versioning.md) and [Installers](installers.md) are the currently active experiments.
